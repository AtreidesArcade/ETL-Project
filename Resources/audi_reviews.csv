I've owned BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, Porsche 911, and Mercedes SL 55 and a Honda Pilot.  The SQ5  is a combination of all of them.  Its rides very comfortably, very stable, and quiet, sporty and with a lot of power and torque. Its a get up and go car, great to drive anywhere in the city or country.  I love the quality and the very advanced technology I feel like I'm in a spaceship.  I've tested the Volvo XC90, it had a very bouncy air suspension and I didn't quite trust their NAV system. I also test drove the RX 350, but again the ride was not as smooth and it just didn't absorb the bumps well, plus it was quite boring to drive. I've never test drove an Audi before until my wife wanted to look at the Audi Q7. After we bought the Q7, I just fell in love with it and had to have one just like it.  The SQ5 is a combination of sports car and comfortable SUV, very adaptable to all my different driving needs.",5

4, on 10/25/17 15:54 PM (PDT),Al ,2018 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Best luxury SUV w/ perfect comfort/sport balance," Very happy with choosing the 2018 Audi SQ5 prestige. Before buying, I compared it to the new F -Pace S, XC60 T8, 43 AMG, and upcoming redesigned  X3 M40i. With Audi SQ5's standard adaptive dampers, you get the best comfort, but also great sportiness when desired. The volvo is for my taste too soft and floaty, while the others are too harsh for a daily driver even with adaptive dampers. Even when driving back-to-back the Lexus RX and the SQ5 on my backroads, I found the SQ5 quieter and soaking up bumps much better than the Lexus RX while being faster at the same time. The virtual cockpit and the modern entertainment system are truly the best and most updated in their class, ahead of other competitors. Having google maps in a 12.3"" screen in front of you w/ live traffic info is unbeatable. The XC 60 T8 comes close, but its infotainment system is rather laggy and ergonomics are not well though-out as everything, incl. heater, are adjusted w/ the main screen. So if that main screen does not boot up quickly or correctly you are basically left in the dark not being able to adjust anything. As confirmed by the recent reliability survey from consumer-reports, Audis are very reliable particularly compared to other luxury brands. Volvo and Jag are the bottom brands in this respect. All in all, it is the best grocery getter I have owned that pertains a dual-personality of keeping the rest of the family comfortable driving from A to B, but yet having the option of embracing windy and twisty roads with speed.",5

6, on 07/16/17 08:19 AM (PDT),Aspen SQ5 ,2018 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Exceptionally balanced vehicle," Ive owned alot of cars since the late 70's, mostly BMW and Porsche. Ive owned 5 M3's, 2 M5's, 4 911's and more recently X5's, a Cayenne and even an X3M. Then I bought a 2012 Audi A8L and fell in love with the brand. Bought wife an Audi allroad and wanted something a little sportier. Wen to the dealer intending to look at the S4/S6/7 line and was considering the S5 sportback. All of the aforementioned is only for context. Im an older guy who appreciates performance and yet I have a perspective of how much performance a person can actually use on the street. I also enjoy a modicum of practicality and so many new cars today offer both that could only be dreamed of 10 or 15 years ago. The SQ5 is without a doubt the best balance of both comfort and performance I have encountered to date in an easy to live with package. Simply amazing the choices we consumers enjoy today. I considered a Macan but the usual Porsche buying experience is a turnoff. Additionally, my local Audi dealer was terrific to deal with and frankly, the SQ5 technology embarrases the Macan as well as the driving dynamics of the 2018 SQ5 feel far superior to the older platform that underpins the Macan. You can't go wrong with the SQ5 and be sure to get the virtual cockpit option.",5
7, on 04/22/18 20:44 PM (PDT),Ajay ,2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),A rare find!," I have owned a 2006 BMW X5, 4.4V8, 2009 Mercedes ML350, 3.5V6, and now this supercharged German beast! I have driven over 4000 mi. in about 6 weeks mainly urban commuting. The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly ""Mickey Mouse ears"" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21"" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs.",4
8, on 03/21/17 18:25 PM (PDT),Tom ,2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),What a Cayenne Turbo driver thinks of this car," This will surprise you. Forget the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. The only real competitor to the SQ5 is the Macan S. If you've had fun in your previous car, expect twice as much in the SQ5. The supercharged engine is far superior to any turbo. The power is instant and gratifying, complemented with the best engine tune in class. The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20"" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people. The SQ5 is not perfect: its only USB port is located in the passenger glove box and its adaptive cruise control does not go all the way to stop. But it stands for Stealth Wealth - people who want to drive the best without spilling the beans. I still can't believe the sleeper status of this car. If you can find one, get one with optional diamond stitching inside! This car looks best in Daytona Gray and Sepang Blue.",5

13, on 12/23/15 15:37 PM (PST),Bart Andeer ,2015 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),What a dissapointment," If interested, you may want to read my reviews on the 2002 Audi S8 (massive engine failure despite excellent service history), 2014 Q5 TDI (Expensive Vibrator).  I also have a 2008 S5 Coupe (so far, so good but it's going soon).  So, this review is not in a vacuum, but with some real Audi ownership experience.  OK, cut to the chase - in Florida Lemon Law circus at present.  It was disappointing with delivery of the car.  The interior is made as cheaply as possible and it shows.  This is not the el cheapo standard seating.  Buzzers going off, alarms going off all the time.  Sport Utility Vehicle.  Well, utility is a joke.  Doors lock when you don't want them to, alarms and warnings going off.  Between Health & Safety and the accountants, the car is pathetic.  Can't even turn the radio off without shutting off the Navigation.   These are but annoyances really.  The real joy began on a long road trip, right after the 5,000 mile service.  About 300 miles into the trip the add oil light came on.  Pulled off into a service station and could not find the oil dip stick.  Called the dealer (Reeves of Tampa, of whom I've been dealing with with the other Audi's and Porsche and think highly of) and informed that they don't have dip sticks.  Well, the upshot of the trip was that I would add maybe 1/3 of a quart every 500 miles.  The day I got home I brought it in and they had it for about a week, said it was fixed and within 110 miles it was telling me to add oil again.  They then had it for two weeks (Total 15 days for Lemon Law) and again the light came on.  Now the purpose of the car is my commute to work, from Tampa, FL to outside New Orleans, LA.  I can't be late looking for Audi dealers to see if I really need oil or not.  So, I then started the Lemon Law process.  Audi had 10 days to respond, but took 14 days.  I took the car back to Reeve for the final repair attempt.  They are allowed 10 days, but took 15 days.  I was told it was fixed, but the lights are on again.  The Better Business Bureau that one must go through stated today that Audi considers the car fixed.  Funny, I just took it to the dealer again today to have them manually check the oil before my next road trip.I'm totally disgusted with Audi Engineering (which seems to be run by accounting these days) and their customer support.  I have not ever had anyone from Audi give a courtesy call and sincerely state that they are sorry for my situation.  Rather, they just basically ignore the timelines set forth by the State of Florida.  Now whether that is due to arrogance, incompetence or being understaffed (due to more accountant management) I can't say, but it is not very impressive what ever the case is.  I requested that this be resolved by 23 December as I have to travel for business again, but that request was not acknowledged.""Truth in Engineering""???  maybe they should revise to ""Truth is, it's Value Engineering"".  Just a suggestion....Update.  While waiting for the arbitration hearing I took it in for the 15,000 mile service with the agreement that there would be no tampering or repair attempts.  After the service the yellow oil idiot light does not come on.  Fixed, well, not exactly.  I took it to another mechanic, had him drain about 2 qts of oil out and that yellow oil light still won't come on, and the computer screen is now different.  Hmmm, change the oil and these things magically change as well.  I'm letting the Federal Trade Commission & FL Attorney General's Office figure that out.  The complaint is under Unfair & Deceptive Business Practices. Finally had the Florida Arbitration Hearing, they ruled in my favor (3-0) but the law is so lame that the settlement was not acceptable to me.  Again attempted to settle this with Audi & Reeves Tampa Audi to no avail.  Now waiting for a court date under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Nearly one year sense the problem started.**Update**  One week prior to the pre trial hearing we went to mediation.  Volkswagen decided after a very brief negotiation to give me essentially what I had been asking for for over a year and pay my attorney's fees as well, and of course that the poorly engineered and overpriced piece of junk (my opinion) back.  I am actually getting rid of my other Audi, an S5 coupe this week.  I want nothing to do with Volkswagen or the local dealership (Reeves Audi of Tampa) in the future due to the way I've been treated.  I have been a gentleman through this entire process, but was bullied, lied to and had the dealership play games which have been reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Attorney General's office for unfair & deceptive business practices.  Used that dealership for 15 years with Porsche & Audi.  No more!Just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing more to add, other than I can't imagine myself ever purchasing another product under VW.Again, I just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing to edit",1

But the MMI system is the pits.  Too many buttons, levers, dials, etc. to search for and too many actions with them before what you want to happen does happen and too much time looking away from the road while searching for what you want.  But it is fun to drive, good size, fairly comfortable, too expensive, visibility not the best, and, considering cost,  behind somewhat in technology.",4
15, on 03/27/17 12:38 PM (PDT),JW ,2016 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Loving My First Audi," Purchased my very first Audi in May 2016...new SQ5!  Had been shopping around for Audi Q3 and also Porsche Macan S.  Test drove the SQ5 one day and new this was the Audi for me.  The performance for a mid-size CUV is impressive.  Great acceleration and stopping power for a performance vehicle.  The quality of craftsmanship/materials is outstanding.  Love the interior design and seats...very comfortable and have great support. The carbon-fiber trim and matte chrome trim in the dash and doors add a very nice and elegant touch.  Love the Google maps feature and wifi hotspot feature.  The Bang and Oulfsen sound system is first rate in a vehicle in this price category.  While many have complained of no USB ports, this can be easily remedied by the USB plug adapter which so far has worked just fine.  Overall I'm very impressed and pleased with the Audi SQ5.  I smile every time I get behind the wheel.  I'm definitely an Audi fan!",5

Only had the car 2 weeks but just completed a trip to Canada and it is just a pleasure to drive. I've had other sports cars before and we just traded a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Audi. No Comparison. Besides the original price the Audi is in another league. Hopefully I'll be saying the same in a few years.,5

So much more fun than a Macan, save the $$, express some individuality and retain some credibility.It's the thinkers' choice. Now 2 years later and still very pleased, has the same, if not better, well proven real life performance as a Macan Turbo or AMG GLC without the obvious overtones or questionable Korean Car Show looks.",5

Traded a 2013 335i sport line which was an amazing car.   Acceleration is less in SQ5 than the Bimmer, but everything else is extremely comparable.   Handling tightly the curvy NC mountain roads, crushing light to light performance on the straight roads of Florida, limo like feel for the date nights with my wife, and of course Quattro safety.   Cannot say enough great things.   My wife is a hard sell on my sports car addiction, but this car  is now her daily driver passing by our corvettes, BMW M4, and others including a Hummer that she calls ""too slow"" (and it is).  Accolades to Audi.   We keep coming back, and have had A6 4.2, S4 Cabrio, but this is our best Audi yet.",5

This vehicle scoots!," I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn‚Äôt get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best ‚Äúpractical‚Äù choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good ‚Äì Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can‚Äôt say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5‚Äù screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own. I look for reasons to run out for something just to drive it!Lastly, golf clubs will fit fore to aft if you slide the rear seats forward a couple inches.",5

Welchel ,2014 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0 Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),A spectacular failure," I see great reviews here for this vehicle and I'd add my name to the list of praise. Great vehicle. Fast. Well-made. Roomy. In fact the only complaint I have is how 'worthless' the car was after I'd driven it 50K plus. The disastrous resale was shockingly terrible. It makes you look at the SQ5 in a whole new light. Brutal. Worse than you'd expect. Did I say terrible? But owning this vehicle has been flawless. It delivered everything I expected. I wished the ride wasn't so hard and seats so unforgiving. But that's the tight ride quality sacrifice, it is a wickedly fast beast and can handle itself easily with all that going on. With room for whole family and much more. A really expensive reality of owning this car is the tires. 2K per 25-30K mi. Kinda eye-opening. Strangely, the MPG never bothered me, it was very good for a beast like this. Final opinion: a bummer of toxic-level bad resale value and operating costs-- yet a brilliant, awesome vehicle.",4

I loved the way it looked, made heads turn, the power, and fuel mileage.  Bought certified lease return because they come with a 100,000 mile warranty.  Made me feel safe.  The car started using a lot of oil. Audi refills for free. The car started using 1/2 every 1000 miles.  I was told normal. It still ran like scalded dag.  I finally complained enough at the dealership that they ""marked"" my engine and did an oil consumption test at 78,000 miles.  The engine was shot.  It needed new pistons and rings.

I maintained my Audi religiously through the dealership, all recalls were done when notified. At 80,000, (2010?)suddenly I had to start adding oil b4 the next oil change service. I questioned the dealership and was told that was to be expected because of the age of the vehicle & to keep adding oil. This continued for 2 1/2 years, and being continually reassured by the dealership. The oil light was coming on more frequently, I kept adding more oil. 2 months ago I went to a different dealership-(the original dealer is no longer dealing in Audi). They told me my pistons were bad, something had been manufactured incorrectly and there had been an issue that Audi knew of. To rectify the problem would cost me $6000. - again the dealer told me to just keep adding oil.  I checked into it on the internet- class action suit years 2008-2011. My car is an early 2012-manufacturered 02/12. Contacted Audi told me to pay 4 an oil compression test, which didn't happened in time. My car is currently sitting in my driveway,@ 109,000 miles, undriveable and awaiting a tow truck because it suddenly does no more than 23 miles an hour.  Audi's not sure what my out come will be!? AND that I should prepared myself for the outcome.  WOW talk about stabbing loyal owners in the back. Get a Mercedes, BMW or Volvo.",3

It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated. The local Audi dealer is good, but with labor rates at $135.00 per Hr. well it just is not worth it. I would not recommend an Audi nor will I purchase one in the future",2

I chose the 3.2 engine because when I test drove the 2.0, I couldn't stand the way the turbo charger whined every time the car shifted. I love the way it hugs the road. I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet. Working the navigation system is confusing.  Not a great paint job. My dog's nails left a deep scratch in the bumper while he was getting into the cargo area.",4

Four years later the engine died, and the dealership wanted to charge me $6,100 to essentially replace the entire top half of the engine, due to a timing chain defect, and they refused to pay anything toward it. Absolutely unacceptable for a car that's basically new, with only approximately 75,000 miles on it. I made sure that I took it for an oil change every 3,000 miles and regularly scheduled service. If you are planning on purchasing an Audi Q5, DON'T DO IT! Do your online research (timing chain/transmission/etc.) and you'll see how poorly made these vehicles are.",1

So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I'm controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don't always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let's not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier ""touch"" controls and less issues.",3

I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that's on top of the $399 price tag for the 'normal' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven't even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi's were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I'm not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless. After this experience I have lost faith in Audi. I definitely will not be purchasing one again. I do not feel that this car is worth the price tag...disappointing altogether.",2

There has never been a time that I‚Äôve driven this car that I haven‚Äôt gotten aggravated to no end with its stupidity. Let me paint a picture about their pre-Sense anti collision assistance. Driving down the New Jersey Turnpike I proceed to pass another car. Turn signal on, drift in the left, start to accelerate and BAM! ABS is activated intent on stoping this car. Well. needless to say I get the sign a peace from the gentleman behind and and really Obnoxious horn beeping. Rightfully so.I look like an idiot that pulled out and tried to stop.  That happen twice. The dealer tells me they‚Äôre aware their pre sense  is very sensitive and it‚Äôs for my protection. really there wasn‚Äôt even a car in front of me.   Issue number two. The transmission.  When I start out from a stop  The transmission has to decide what gear it supposed to be in before we go, clunking and banging . OK off we go. the transmission  is interested in doing one thing and that‚Äôs getting into the highest gear Possible before you go 15 feet no matter what your input is. You would think? being a perceived highline German car Audi would‚Äôve engineered out this unsophisticated jolting and horrible mapping of a transmission.

Better yet here‚Äôs an exercise if you‚Äôre so inclined to test drive one. On ramp simulation. Bring the car down to about 5 miles an hour, now there‚Äôs room to Merge in. Consider allTraffic is doing 60 to 70 miles an hour. so punch the Pedel  to the floor. I guarantee there will be a three second delay before that car moves. pretty scary with your nose out in traffic.  There are other issues but I think you get my point .I would seriously think long and hard and test drive the hell out of this car if you decide to consider. From experience your dealership will be no help.

I made the switch to the 2018 Audi Q5 from a 2013 Lexus RX350. This Audi is definitely a beautiful luxury vehicle, and I love bells and whistles in my car so I got the Prestige version. If you have any personal padding in your backside, you will hate these hard seats. I just could not get comfortable no matter what I adjusted, it cut me in the back of the thigh. Driving for any period of time was painful.  It drove beautifully, and was responsive, but I just didn't click with this car. Technology wise,  I love the heads up display that kept me informed of the local speed limit, and how fast I was going right next to each other. But, I found the center console technology had to get used to, dial this, push that, if there a 3 lines on one side there's another menu, a plus on the other side of the screen meant another menu. Dial, menu, dial, menu. There is NO room in the console, no place to put your phone, very hard to reach cup holders, and a center console box that is so small it wouldn't hold a small box of Kleenex. The shifter moves back and forth for reverse, neutral, and drive pressing one button, but there was a separate button to push for park... and no noise alerting you to being in park. The car is so quiet,  and the radio is still on until you open a door, half the time I didn't remember if I turned the car off. And the worst thing I could not get used to was no memory seats that side back when you get out of the vehicle, and no remote start. Remote start is not available in any Audi. I traded it in after only 2 months, and  it lost $10,000 in value! I absolutely would have gone back to a new Lexus if I liked the grill on the last few years versions, if they change that it a few years, I will go back to Lexus.

It sat in the shop for 4 days while they replaced both headlight assemblies.  Then last week, with just 2500 miles on the car, the engine failed which landed me broken-down on the side of the road with my 90-year-old Grandpa on a short road trip.

I decided the Audi was a superior ride and overall a better price point equipped with the features I wanted. I custom ordered my Q5 and waited 4 months for delivery. My first week with the vehicle I had two problems, a popping/clicking sound behind the dash (they said was normal) and a metal/clicking sound when you release the brake pedal. 4 months later the brake pedal just got fixed (replaced brake booster assembly). Overall the ride and drive (especially on the freeway) and interior quiet are superior. The custom wrap-around warm weather package seats took some getting used to; I ordered as I found the standard seats too short. They make it difficult sliding in and out of the vehicle, and they're hard. And overall, the car doesn't fit me very well (I'm 5'11 and 190#). The interior quality of materials are cheap; I feel as if I'm in a Toyota or Suburu. Plasticy doors, thresholds, etc. Nothing compared to my former BMW.

The Audi seat doesn't adjust to a low enough position for my taste, and while it has way more than enough legroom and seat travel, my left shoulder and left arm have nowhere to go once the seat is positioned because the B-pillar is really awkward.

Operating the yacht handle shifter is weird too. I own a 2014 S5 with the 7 speed DSG and this Q5 7-speed is not the DSG, but it is extremely smooth and quiet and fun to shift the paddles. On the highway, seventh gear will get you good mileage, but it's worthless for accelerating. Sixth gear though, is perfect and dropping to 4th at 75 mph really wakes things up.

I have always had at least one model of BMW in my stable since 1969 and was ready to buy an X3. However, the Q5 was more to my liking due to a smoother ride ( hate stiff run flat tires) and superior performance from the 2 liter engine and technology that sets Audi apart from the competition. I also tested the Mercedes and Volvo and found them lacking compared to the Audi. First, the ride is firm but compliant and the point and shoot handling is magnificent. Secondly, the adaptive cruise control is on a par with the Subaru eyesight system and easy to use. Thirdly, the cabin is serenely quiet and beautifully appointed. I opted for the warm weather package which includes heated and ventilated sport seats which are very comfortable on long trips. Also the B&O sound system just blows away the others in sound quality. Apple Car Play is great and intuitive. The controls for all the technology takes a bit of getting used to but becomes intuitive after a while. Acceleration is excellent for an SUV and the WOW factor of the mapping display is addictive. For an old BMW enthusiast, I am extremely satisfied with my first Audi.

Loved the A6 Prestige so much I ordered a 2018 Q5 for my wife as soon as the adaptive cruise and other packages were available. It was equipped with comfort seats and everything else except warm weather package because the 2017 comfort seats were comfortable and the 2017 sports were very hard, narrow and less comfortable. The initial release cars were not fully equipped and the dealer did not have but 1 or 2 demos to test, not were we told the 2018 Q5?seats were being redesigned. From what others now say, the vented warm weather sports seats of the 2018 were made more comfortable,  though the seat bottoms and back still are very narrow with stiff plastic at the edge of the bottom and narrow upper bolsters. We waited 3 months to receive car and drove on short trips around town for a month. Then, took 2 hour trip ( 4 hours round trip) with spouse.  Both of us could hardly walk when it was over, and it took a couple days to get back to normal. From that point on, every time we sat in the Q5, our backs and bottoms began to hurt so much we couldn‚Äôt drive it any longer. The 8-way seats do not provided enough adjustments to fine a sweet spot and we could not live with the narrow seat bottom with hard sides, the lacked lumbar support for the passenger/limited height adjustment for driver, and very little upper back support. Plus the rear of the seat bottom cupped our bottoms in such a way as to cause pressure on our lower back. The dealer offered to buy it back as a used car and we took about a $10k hit, which was a bit better than if I had trued to trade. In hindsight, we should not have rushed to buy the 2018 Q5 just because we liked my 2017 A6, though it was a very cool looking, well engineered and popular vehicle around here. I personally loved the Infotainment and vehicle technology systems because they were so easy to use and were controlled from the center console, not on a touch screen. Plus, I got 31+ mpg on the one trip using the adaptive cruise/lane keeping to control the car. Only after we had to go looking for a substitute did we learn that the 2018 Volvo XC60 Inscription which came out after we ordered the Q5 offers all that the Q5 offers with great comfort and just a bit less mileage. The Bottom Line: If comfort is something important, better test drive a Q5 with both kinds of seat configurations on a trip of at least an hour or so before buying. The comfort seats are anything but comfortable. They could bring on back troubles that never were anticipated.

While we agreee with what others have written about the new 2018 Q5, the initial quality issues that we've encountered around the steering wheel and driver side mirror are extremely disappointing.  While we pointed out both issues on initial delivery of the car, both have unfortunately become long drawn out issues with service and then corporate Audi got involved.  The driver mirror had some unexplained heavy caking on inside, sides and bottom (almost like paint primer) that service rushed to clean, which they only got about 1/3 off.  Then left us with the car, so that they could work on it again when we brought back to replace the steering wheel that had a 1"" slit in the leather wheel at delivery.  Now the LED 1/8"" strip on that side view mirror is popping out, along with moisture seeping in and service is saying it's not covered!  Would be interested in hearing from any other consumers with similar problem on the driver mirror and how you are resolving it, as replacing an entire side view mirror is quite expensive.",2

It was a 3 year lease.   The pro. Better cabin material,  technology was very advance, cabin noise is low during cruising, car handing was good, technology is not intuitive.The Bad.ABS activation at 24/25 MPH produce 2-3 clicks that driver can feel thru the gas pedal and can be heard by passenger.  Pre-sense is way too sensitive for NYC.  On numerous occasions,  while parallel parking.  The car breaks itself for no reason.  I was going less than 5 MPH with absolutely nothing behind or on the side.   This wouldn't be a problem if it can be permanently disabled but this requires going thru the 5-6 steps in the menu system to disable it every time the car starts.The RMP/throttle seems low when car is in reverse.   While releasing the break in reverse (without stepping on the gas) you can feel the car vibrate as it was going to cut out.  Obviously it doesn't cut out but surely it shouldn't vibrate.Honestly, I felt my switch over from the X3 to Q5 was a bad choice.   I end up paying more on a monthly basis thinking the 2018 Q5 was a step up.  In technology sense it was a step up, but my expectation of the basic car functions was missed.   Bottom line.  New isn't always better.  I think Audi rush the release for the major model change.",2

I was concerned about ""trading down"" to a 6-cylinder engine, having owned a MB ML55 AMG, far and away the best vehicle I'd ever owned.  The Q5 is definitely a match, stride-for-stride, much to my surprise.  My two first impressions in the vehicle were ""fit and finish"" in the interior and the sound system by Bang and Olafsen---they were my ""deciders.""  Now, after 4 years of Audi ownership, I'd again cite the fit and finish, the sound system, but would add the quiet ride, the confidence I have in the vehicle, and the support I have received from the dealership's service department.  Owning the Q5 has been a very positive experience.  On the negative side of the ledger has been, of course, the tremendous depreciation, which I suppose is common to all highline vehicles.  I experienced that with the Mercedes, and am so doing with the Q5, despite the excellent care it has received from both the dealership and me.  Whether I get another Audi or something else depends on the deal when I go looking----lots of badges are good, but this has been a good experience.

I've driven many different types of cars, trucks and SUVs in my lifetime (I'm in my fifties) and have never really owned a vehicle that I would say hit the ideal sweet spot or did just about everything.  But the Q5 does just that for me. Interior: beautifully laid out with comfortable seats for the long ride and leather surfaces where the leather looks new all the time with no cracks because Audi does not stretch the leather. Electronics take awhile to learn but are fairly intuitive. Exterior: very German, very nice lines, turns heads. Ride:  smooth and comfortable. Ignore all those reviews that talk about the suspension being overly stiff. I wouldn't even use the word ""stiff"" to describe it. Yes, it is firmer than a Lexus or a Buick but those cars are just too soft and feel like minivans to me. The Audi feels sportier and absorbs the bumps nicely but you are still connected to the road. Handling: steering is precise or sloppy and cornering is very good unlike other SUVs with some body roll when entering an interchange which is not unusual for the height of this car or class. I have not driven in the snow yet so cannot comment but rain was very good. Power: very responsive and great acceleration off the block and at passing speeds. More power than you would ever need. Can tow up to 4,400 pounds which is very good. Safety: Excellent ratings by the government and top safety pick by IIHS. The blind spot indicators on large mirrors are very helpful. Disappointments: the lumbar seating adjustment could be a bit firmer for me, but not too bad. Could have more storage for spare change (I use the ash try which is very small). The phone charging takes place in the glove compartment so your phone is not handy although it is connected through bluetooth. I know, safer that way but I like to be able to grab my phone when I need to.",5

Of course, when you're driving long distances (on highways) is when you want to listen to music!  There is also a hesitancy when trying to enter a highway from a stop or slow speed - you jam the gas pedal to the floor and the engine takes a couple seconds to respond.  Like it's saying to itself, ""I think he wants us to go now, so let's get going.""  Not good.  Once engaged by the transmission, the 2.0 has enough pickup, so it's not the engine.  It's the transmission engagement that is slow. Lastly, it used hi-test gas (91 octane or higher), which makes it more expensive to run, as it only gets around 15+mpg combined.    That all said, it is a very well built automobile in materials, construction, and detail.  Most certainly better quality automobile than ANY of the Asian imports.

It has been about a year now, and I have less than 9000 miles on it, but I have slowly become less fond of the vehicle. I have had a rattle in the driver's side door fixed once already, but it has come back. I have another rattle coming from the cargo space cover, that makes noise every time I go over a bump, such as speed bump or when pulling into driveways. There also seems to be another rattle coming from the seat belt mount on the driver side. The sun visors will not stay up when moved up to the windshield. Living in Florida, I use the visors daily, but the quickly fall about 2 inches when put them up, which Audi has told me is ""normal.""  I have owned Chevy, GMC, Mitsubishi, Kia and Jeep, and have never encountered a problem with the sun visors staying in place.     It also seems that Audi has gone out of its way to ensure that the base model ($42,000) has as few features as possible IE: radio and electronics. Radio presets can only be operated from the dashboard, not on the steering wheel, and no back-up camera, which is basically standard on all vehicles in this day and age.

This Audi does have all the upgrades including the 20 inch wheels and handles extremely well for a smallish 4500 pound SUV.  The acceleration of 6.5 seconds to 60 is amazing for a diesel that has ranged between 30 and 39 miles per gallon so far. I have noticed that the temperature conditions affect the mileage which must be a diesel thing but recently I got 39.5 MPG driving to Chicago on a 70 degree day going Northbound maybe I had a tail wind who knows.   In summary the handling, acceleration , and mileage are ABSOLUTELy splendid.  Certainly some of the 500 HP sport model SUV's are faster but who wants to own a vehicle that gets 15MPG average?I have not had one issue after four months and 9000 miles and  the car is extremely quiet under highway driving conditions.My only complaints are the short warranty period of 50000 miles accompanied by 2600 in ""regular maintanence""  costs  and the center console which impedes the movement of my right leg a bit. The lack of a few  electronic options is really nothing I can not live without like I need more distractions while I am whipping down the highway.  I will let you know if anything goes wrong I am hoping to actually be able to drive a German vehicle for 150K carefree miles which was impossible with a BMW. I can not imagine an Acura or Lexus handling anywhere near as well so if you like performance with economy the TDI is the wave of the future.",5

After this repair visit noticed shuddering and bucking with acceleration on inclines.  Took car in and was told needed a new fuel injector.  The car had less than 15000 miles.  Injector replaced.  Took car from dealer and before I could get home, problem started again.  After exam was told was fuel related and should try different stations.  A month later, after trying every station in my city, problem still existed and took car back to dealer for closer look.  After several days of exam, car was diagnosed with severe carbon build up in engine.  A shame such a nice car has so many issues. I'm done with Audi.",3

The Audi is beautifully finished, and an extremely comfortable vehicle.   I have had minor issues with rattles and noises, including having to change the hinges on the rear passenger door.   In also long for some of the technology that I had in my 2009 Acura, like knowing the tire pressure in each tire.  I also find the blue-tooth entertainment system unfriendly to use, and the audio response quite poor.   Frequently, the numbers are wrong.  You can say ""six"" and end up with a seven in the number.  Handling is good, though the electronic steering takes some time to get used to.  I miss the tightness (& lower body roll ) of the Acura, but over time have gotten to where I really like my Audi.Last, for a 2015 model, the interface with your mobile phone is horrid.   The Hyundai Sonata  unfortunately has a better interface than the Audi.   If you are looking for a good, comfortable car, this one is for you.

The ride is sort of smooth but the tires don't seem to provide much in the way of comfort than you would expect. For the price point of this car, the stereo system is abysmal.  It is like listening to music in a tin can.   My mistake was not checking that out before hand.   Assumed it this day and age and at this price point that he would be as good as the Acura's. When I took it in to find out if there is anything  I was so much is told that it can't compare.   So I took it to an expert who told me it would cost me no less than 1500 to make it sound halfway decent.  The whole navigation system seems OK just a bit complicated.

She handles lovely around the windy road corners. Things I notice this time of year are: she's quick to defrost, the seat warmers are a godsend, she heats up nicely - gets toasty warm inside. Gas mileage is great. She's easy to park.

We had a huge snow storm here and I live at the bottom of a serious hill; downhill assist got me home safely. It kind of takes over the braking and all you have to do is steer.

Of course you should purchase ANY luxury/GERMAN vehicle with concerns regarding maintenance and price, because it will happen eventual on any make/model at any time.  Having said that, Audi's are by far the best value in class.  they are more sporty than their counterparts with a younger more sleek feeling.  The 2010 Q5 drive smooth and easy at low speeds, and is tight and responsive at high speeds.  the car feels as good to drive as it looks going down the road for thousands less than its competitors, or a new model for that matter.  buy one with a few miles for under 20K and you will have a good car for years to come, so long as you get the maintenance plan as well! very well put together, inside and out.",5

Sure my car had 91,000 miles on it and had Carfax Service records.  So far after owning it for only 6 months, it's already has had to have a complete front end re-done,  hoses replaced, they still can't figure out what's wrong with the steering that 'chatters' when you turn to the left that was $3,000 worth of work.  But what has happened now is that I was noticing the anti-freeze disappearing but no leaking.  The oil cap was milky which meant the antifreeze was leaking into the engine and you could watch it disappearing.  I had the car towed to the Audi mechanic.  The warranty I bought for $3,000 isn't worth the paper it's written on, they have loop holes in it so they don't have to fix it.  Basically the engine needs to be replaced.  According to the mechanic the engine is so difficult to disassemble and tons of man hours and dollars, it's easier to replace than taking it apart.  So now I have no car to drive.  I have over the years owned used cars from Mercedes to BMW's and have never had a problem with high miles.  This car is a joke.  My only resolve is to turn it back into the bank and then I will be stuck with the residual to pay for years.  Anyone have any ideas? Or heard of this kind of car tragedy? Update:  The dealership refuses to do anything about it.  The credit union can't do anything about it.  How can they in all consciousness sell you a car that is a lemon?UPDATE:The car ended up having $7k worth of work to get the thing running again.  It then started to over heat.  I had to turn the car back into my bank and I had to take a hit on my credit because of it.  I wasn't about to pay over $25k for a car that kept breaking down.  I called the Audi Corporate office, of course nothing they could or would do so Audi lovers beware, there are bad cars out there that will break you!  Other Audi owners of this model and make have made the same comments to me (I ask when I see one) no good engines in these cars.  I loved the look of it, the way it handled etc.  but their engines suck!  Thanks Audi for ruining my credit!!",1

They told him they had no idea why the water pump went (not common on 3.2 engines). They told my husband to wait and fixed it right then and there.Now that is service. It is great on the road it hugs it. Great miles on the highway driving. I would buy another one in a heart beat. No regrets.,5

If I could change one thing it still would be opting for all-season radials instead of the summer performance tires.

The diesel power is very different to the 3.2 version. It comes as more of of a  surge, rather than the instant zippy power of a petrol motor, but when it surges, it just seems to keep producing more and more power! I chose this over the 3.2 because it is more economical and has even faster acceleration. (0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds.

Shifting smooth all the way up; sport mode is RESPONSIVE. Interior is beautiful. MMI and voice work, but there is a learning curve: reading instruction book helps!

Audi has combined looks, performance and fun in their 2010 Q5! I've started reading the owner's manual to get up to speed. There is a lot to this car and it will take awhile to understand all the bells and whistles but it's worth it. I bought a Meteor Gray (great color) Premium Plus and added 19"" wheels and the B&O stereo. I'm looking forward to driving this vehicle for a long time. Test drive one of these and you'll see that Audi has it all over Mercedes, BMW & Lexus. ",4.875

I drive it most days and just love it. It's not too high, so I don't feel like I have to step up to get in to it.  It's so fun to drive, I'm getting in to work early because I can't wait to drive it.  I can't find anything about it I would change.  The mileage is great!

The Q5 was worth the wait! Get the S-line pkg. The 20 inch chrome wheels put the finishing touch on this black beauty.  This is a great looking SUV with the best handling, ride, and appearance of all the mid-size SUVs (BMW/Lexus etc). Try the Q5 if you're tired of seeing yourself at every traffic-light and/or parking space. My wife loves the way it handles and rides and the engine has enough power to satisfy her driving habits. I've owned other Audi's making us qualified for a $1K loyalty discount. It has a first class dynamic 505 watt sound system.

Great finish compared to other luxury SUVs.   Audio: A+  The MMI interface allows you to control your Ipod on the MMI 6.5'' (I think) screen.  Very useful.   There are also 2 more speakers, 2 more than other luxury SUVs.  Performance:  Drives like a sports-sedan.  A+  Uniqueness:  Hardest car to get in North America (Forbers article).

Performance transmission gear sends you off like a rocket, tight handling like a sports model and a great exterior make this price the deal of the year.  My family of 5 fits comfortably.

Drove everything in the class, X3, VW Toureg, Nissan Murano, Toyota Highlander Mercedes etc and nothing at all comes even close to the level of refinement, exterior looks, interior (Audi sets the bench mark here). 270 Bhp, stunning LED daytime running lights, adequate usable space with the seats folded down. My wife absolutely loves it and made quick work of her first Costco run in the Q5 easily loading everything into the back with a smile on her face. (happy wife, happy life).

McCarthy ,2016 Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Big Bang for the Buck," While not inexpensive or as technologically advanced as some other offerings in this car-size segment, the 2016 Q5 is well worth the investment. The seating and access are very comfortable; the ride is sure-footed and quiet and provides feedback from the road. The experience encapsulates what German mean when they speak of ""Fahrtvergn√ºgen"" (joy of driving = control + security + responsiveness). The cumbersome navigation system in this model and the lack of a full range of passive safety features detract from the overall score. I would have given it five stars otherwise. I bought the SUV as a certified pre-owned vehicle with 11k miles on it and a six-year warranty. Not bad. The gas mileage has been better than anticipated (22 around town, up to 29 on the highway doing about 75mph. Best car I have ever owned.",4

Great design inside and out, comfortable, quick, economical, reliable, stylish.  A small thing but please put a plate on the rear bumper underneath the hatch so it's not so easy to scratch.  Please catch up quick to technology; Japanese and American tech is better especially regarding the voice control.  Audi's is too frustrating to bother with.  I had better in a rented KIA 7 years ago.  Also, adaptive cruise control and surround cameras should be standard in this day and age.  One of the major reasons I leased was I knew there'd be better tech on future models.  I guess you could say I'm exclusively dating the Q5 but ain't going to get married !",4

I obviously adored my Lexus, but the new RX is huge, and the NX was a good size but had nasty yellowish pleather interior, boring handling and that awful spindle grill.   Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It's appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I'm proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.UPDATE, 12/27/2017, 1.5 years of ownership:I still love the looks and ride of my Q5.  There are things I don't love, though.  The mirrors are too big and block my view a lot, and the sun visors don't extend and aren't long enough for me (I'm 5'3"").  Voice control 'granny' is pretty slow.  The bluetooth connection with my iphone is quite variable, and the voice with google maps only works about 50% of the time (the built in navigation I don't even use, I'd much rather use my phone apps).  The a/c is not as good as the one on my 15 year old Lexus).  My windshield wiper sometimes takes a random trip across the window.  The doors are very heavy and tend to close when I don't want them to if I'm entering or exiting the car in a parking spot that isn't level.   Stuff in the back cargo area consistently shifts around a lot more than it ever did in my RX, though I'm not sure why, and I really don't like that I can't close the back cargo door with an interior button.  These are all relatively minor drawbacks, though there are many.  However, I really do love the way the car rides and handles, and it's still one of the classiest looking SUVs on the road.6/2018 UPDATE: Still love my Audi except for the MMI (controls all infomation electronics), which is has gone dead twice in 1.5 years.",4

When the car was 2 days old the backup warning system failed and I backed into a mailbox   The dealer told me the system sensors needed a deep cleaning, which they did, but would not repair a small dent.  I complained to Audi, they said it is up to the dealer because that would be covered under the warranty.  The dealer said Audi refuses to pay for the damage.  During the next six months the GPS would freeze and the MMS system would simply not turn on at times.  I complained to the dealer again this times they told me there was an update to the software due to problems that Audi was having.  The dealer and Audi Still refused to take responsibility for a failed system.

However, in this case I ended up leasing the a newer version of the exact same Q5.  Why? because I test drove everything else out there and could not bear to part with the Q5.   Superb all around car and hands down the best engines on the road today.   After 36K miles on the 2014, zero flaws and the exterior and interior still look it came off the showroom.

I bought a 2016 Q5 3.0T.  Its great to drive a true German car again.  The steering in this car allows you to feel the road.

It is heavier then the 2.0 and better in ice and snow. The 3.0 liter is very quick and really goes when you need it. It is quiet with windows up and the sun roof is huge with no vibration with Windows up. A first for me. Voice command could be better and that's my only complaint.

I have chosen the S-Line model, which has some of the nicest body lines that compliment the Black Optics over Ibis white color scheme. Equipped with the Tech package and 21"" wheels, the Q5 is pure enjoyment! The black leather interior is practical, functional and very comfortable. I do have the Sport Interior, which gives you the flat bottom steering wheel and firmer sport seats with thigh supports. The Bang and Olefsen stereo is a superb sounding, enriching pleasure every time I play it a little on the loud side. With a well laid out display, the MMI response could be more responsive, but it is not burdensome. Satisfaction and contentment are equally matched with adrenaline and excitement whenever you need the supercharged V6 engine to come to life. Excellent throttle response leads to spirited acceleration, seat planting torque and miles of smiles as you allow this performance SUV to stretch it's legs. Audi has put forth a nicely balanced, visually and sensory pleasing vehicle at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this drivetrain package over the 2.0T level, as you get a firmer suspension, larger brakes, dual outlet exhaust and a horsepower/torque range that will put enjoyment at your finger tips!",5

Overall the Nav is easy and accurate to set.  Voice controls works as well as any of them but could use work.  The push button start works well and the best feature is the side mirror closure when the locks and alarm are set.  Works great and all automatic on closure and on open.  The Audi grille and overall look is special and there's plenty of room in the rear compartment.  I also like that you can roll the rear seats forward for more cargo room, very nice.

262, on 01/26/16 07:06 AM (PST),Bill ,2016 Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Not so Great SUV!," We bought the 2016 3.0 TDI prestige package with all options and initial we are very happy with the choice we made.  Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV's.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.  In my opinion ""Made in Germany"" is not that good anymore.  Its paid for so I have to keep it for a while.",5
263, on 11/26/15 05:32 AM (PST),Q5 TDI driver ,2016 Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Early impression of a 2016 Q5 TDI," I've become a big fan of diesels for their driving characteristics and efficiency.  The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I'm enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I'm pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase.",5

The owners before us were very meticulous, and they had very few issues, and we have now put 6,000 miles on it and still have had no problems. The review that complains about having to replace the brakes at 30k is driving in the city constantly, I can tell because they also had to have the carbon build-up cleaned. Carbon build-up is a fact of life for direct injected engines, but when the car is driven at highway speed, the combustion chamber gets hot enough to burn off the carbon. Also, take care of your car. Change the oil with VW 502 00 approved oil every 5,000 miles, and keep up on scheduled maintenance. ",4.625

Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want.

The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK.  Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors.

I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23.  The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver.  The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car.

Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car.  Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads.  MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving.

My dealership finally took it in and called me initially to repair it for $1,800, which they said if I don't take care of will cost 8K worth of damage. They were not able to give me a cause for it and I told them to give me the quote and details and I will take it and fix it for cheaper elsewhere. Then they said they will contact Audi and call me back if anything can be done. After a few hours they called and said Audi would cover the entire cost and they repaired it within 24 hrs for no cost. I am happy they did that, but I am sure this has affected the value of my car and my fear of something else going wrong with it. I bought this car brand new thinking I will not have to deal will damages from low quality build and not including the regular maintenance I take it for, I have had to go to the dealership many more times for fixing recalls and other minor sensor issues.

I loved the car then and I still do today, despite Audi's diesel fiasco.Pros:1. This is a very comfortable car to sit in on the commute and long hauls. The front seats are great unless you want to pretend it's a sports car, in which case they lack a bit of lateral support. The Q5 does its suburban transport function perfectly well and the panoramic roof glass gives it an airy feeling.  Like all the Audis in my experience, the driver's sight lines are excellent.2. The fuel economy has gone from outstanding to somewhat higher than that.  In the same mixed driving pattern since purchase, I'm now averaging 31-33 mpg measured at the tank (the low end of that range in winter).  High 30s with pure highway driving.  For a 4400 pound truck with a 5000 pound towing capacity, that's supernatural. 3. About that towing capacity; I still haven't hauled any really heavy loads but the Q5 tows 1000 pounds of motorcycle plus trailer with barely any hit on fuel consumption.4. Driving dynamics are very good within limits.  Body roll is minimal for an SUV, the steering is reasonably quick and accurate without being nervous, braking effort is linear and absolute stopping power is good but not stellar.  Ride quality is quite good, striking an excellent balance of composed cornering without too stiff damping.  While I usually don't ask much of the engine and rarely spin it above 1800 rpm, when acceleration is called for at any speed that initial torque surge is amazing.5. The Q5 is good in winter, particularly since I put on Nokian Hakkapeliitta winter tires (probably not needed but they provide more braking performance in snow).  Excellent ground clearance, the wheel wells don't get packed up with snow and the traction control is effective without being intrusive.  It would be nice to have a locking center diff but the Quattro is perfectly fine for most snow conditions.  The defroster does a good job but it would help to have a windshield option as it does get packed up with snow and ice at the base and left side of the window.6. VWAG finally has a plan to deal with the 3.0 liter diesel scam and it looks good.  Last year I got a $500 debit card for any purchase and another $500 card to use exclusively at Audi dealerships.  Now they're on the verge of recall the car to implement the fix, which appears to be limited to ECU reprogramming.  We will have to see if this adversely affects performance or fuel economy with no third party reports yet, as far as I know.  One cause for optimism is that a friend of mine with a Golf Sportwagen TDI had no degradation of mileage or performance after recent fix of his 2.0 liter I-4.  Audi will also evidently give me something in the range of $7000 compensation with a smaller amount coming from Bosch.  That will have a significant impact in cost of ownership (and might put me in a new Porsche Cayman or Corvette Grand Sport when I trade in my other car next year!).Cons:1. The steering has poor on-center feel which is a bit irritating when I set out on highway driving although after a bit of time I stop noticing it.2. While the stopping power is adequate, the initial brake feel is spongy.  I much prefer brakes that have a strong initial bite and linear rise in stopping power, like those on my Audi S4. 3. The defroster is adequate but in very snowy conditions it would be nice to have a heated windshield base or heated washer fluid.4. I would prefer to have engine stop start switch in a more intuitive position.  The system itself is not bad; the engine restarts quickly and smoothly.  But I only want to use it when I anticipate a relatively long stop, like arriving at a traffic light that has just turned red.  So I am turning the system on and off multiple times in local driving but it's hard to find the switch without taking my eyes off the road.5. The interior trim on the driver's side door and left front of the dashboard reflects sunlight on the instruments and windshield under some circumstances.  It's an occasional minor irritation.  Overall, it's hard to find much to complain about with this car!",4

Seriously, I traded my 2002 Audi S8 which had massive engine failure at 118,000 miles for a new '14 TDI.  I commute from Tampa, FL to just beyond New Orleans, LA.  I was looking for the ability to tow a small trailer, get good mileage and like all wheel drive.  Seemed pretty good, but there was a huge catch.  Vibration.  There is something called vibration tolerance.   It seems the longer a human is subjected to vibrations, the more aggravating the particular vibrations (generally low in frequency) become.  Every trip I made (10 - 11 hours total trip time) I was feeling pretty bad upon completion, nauseous and jittery.  I've owned diesel cars before and have been a ship captain for many years.  I'm accustomed to diesels.  I've never had this issue before.  This is not something that could come as a surprise to engineers.  It is well known.  I got the impression that accountants were running the engineering.  It's called ""Value Engineering"".   After being fully prepared to follow Florida Lemon Law, Audi corporate made be a generous offer to trade for a 2015 Audi SQ5.  Most regrettably I accepted this offer.  You may be interested in my review of the 2015 Audi SQ5 when posted.

Gas mileage is outstanding. Getting calculated 37MPG on a long trip is common. I'm averaging 32.2MPG in 18,000 miles of ownership. Traction is outstanding with quattro. OEM Michelin Latitude's are ok, not great, so I think traction could be further improved with better tires. Shifting is smooth in all gears, although the shift from 1 to 2 only after the idle stop was engaged is the slightest bit rough. Interior materials are first rate, layout is very intuitive. MMI is very good, nav takes a few minutes to start up on initial startup, I really like the LACK of a touch screen nav system. Everything is controlled through the selector wheel and buttons, Hands are closer to the wheel, no stretching for the nav screen and less eyes off the road. Cargo capacity is ok, but you know that buying this vehicle - if you need a Suburban, go buy a Suburban.Audi's tend to be a bit more sporty than the Mercedes, and on par with BMW. Consequently the ride is never harsh, but a bit firmer than you may be used to coming out of a Merc, or certainly a Lexus, which places a higher priority of comfort over better handling. Having said that, this is a heavy vehicle and center of gravity will be higher than any sedan you compare it to. Comparing this size SUV to any other comparably sized SUV, it's hard not to like everything it offers. Price is a reflection of the technology, materials, and performance you get, which is to say, it doesn't come cheap.Comfort, room, performance, fuel efficiency, quality of materials, and build quality, Compare it to anything you like, you won't find everything this vehicle - as a TDI - delivers anywhere else.",5

The diesel has so much low end torque that you'll blow off kids in hot cars without meaning to.  The car is beautiful and comfortable and the sound system excellent.  All that being said, I'll never buy another Audi based on this car.   The car 'lags' when trying to accelerate just a little from an already-slow speed (like turning at an intersection with pedestrians; or waiting for a break in oncoming cars while turning) leaving you in dangerous situations at times.  The electronics are WAY behind the curve: you have to take your eyes off the road and hand off the wheel for FAR too much.

I've been very careful during the break-in period, which happened during extreme cold temperatures and much snow and ice on the roads for a few weeks in February. The car would start flawlessly every time even at temperatures of -20 F in the mountains of Colorado. I've averaged 25.5 mpg in the city during cold weather and snowy roads. On a 180 mile round trip from Winter Park to Steamboat Springs, where you start at 8800 ft, go down to 7000, then up to almost 11,000 ft and then down to 6,800 ft I averaged 35 mpg with 5 people in the car, skis on the roof and a fully loaded trunk. From Boulder to Colorado Springs and back I averaged 41.5 MPG.Update: After owning this vehicle for two years I'm just hoping it is not too good to be true with the diesel scandal. I bought it because it had power and speed to spare while using very little fuel and polluting less than a gasoline car. That may still be true for CO2 emissions, but it is not true for NOx emissions, and that is very disappointing. I'm hoping the fix will not reduce my power or fuel economy. I've averaged almost 31 mpg over 25,000 miles, with no mechanical or electrical problems. My biggest complain is the Google Earth based GPS. The time to arrival algorithm is not very accurate, especially when driving in the mountains. It can be 30 minutes off on a two hour drive. In the city though, it is accurate enough.I bought snow tires to get one more season out of the all seasons it came with, but I still think the original tires will not last as long as expected. The Audi Q5 is excellent in the snow with these new snow tires. I did notice an appreciable difference in traction, but it does not corner as well as with the all seasons, as expected.Last year we drove the car from Colorado to California and from Colorado to the East Coast. It was such a pleasure we may do it again this year. The seats get a bit hard after 6 hours drive, so we bought a seat cushion for long trips after the first one and our bottoms thanked us.Update: The major change I've seen is my mileage has increased to an average of 31.6 of combined driving in the third year, from 30.8 the first year. I don't know if that's due to the engine loosening up and becoming fully burned in, or because the original tires are getting worn out. I have 34,000 miles and I have measured up to 40.5 MPG on one trip. Usually the computer is off by up to 1 mpg, so figure at least 38-39 mpg on the highway through 3 Colorado mountain passes.I hope Audi can fix the diesel cheating problem without affecting performance. I don't know of any other car that can perform similarly or better (range, MPG, AWD, ground clearance, acceleration, comfort, luxury, quality). Maybe next year the plug-in hybrid can come close or surpass it.Update (Mar 26, 2017): Audi may offer to buy back my 3.0 TDI Audi Q5 if they cannot solve the diesel problems by December 2017. I would take them up on the offer if I could find another vehicle that performed equally or better than what I have for a similar price. I don't think there is one, if I want similar range (600+ miles), acceleration (6.2 sec 0-60 mph), fuel efficiency (30.8 MPG combined, down a bit because of the use of snow tires), road clearance (7.9 in) , turning diameter (38.1 ft), and combination of length and cargo space on an AWD car.

For the price point, it is a smooth cruiser but one can wake up the beast by shifting to S mode. I was crossshopping current year lexus NX, Mercedes GLC (and GLK), and BMW X6 at higher price points and they did not deliver the versatile appeal yo the driver senses as the Q5 could. Although I bought mine pre-owned at high highway miles, there is no doubt it still feels and runs like new. The interior fit and finish have held up well indicative of the attention of detail befitting a German luxury mobile. The cons are that because the standard suspension is fairly sporty and firm, rough roads may be felt more but its manageable. If you can, find a Q5 with adaptive dampers and audi drive select and youll have 3+ cars of feel in one! Also, this MY has piston and ring oil consumption issues as well as timing chain tensioner flaws. Luckily it was fixed in mine. Do your due diligence and find one that has these fixes done and car will be bulletproof.

The handling is superb, much more car like than truck like. The comfort is very good, the seats are much better than the Mercedes and it seems like there are more adjustment options.

Audi's First Gen R8 will be a history maker well into it's 3rd and 4th Generations.  Much has been said about the 1st Gen Tiptonic  Automatic Transmission but after 13,000+ miles I would buy this Supercar all over again. Absolutely no transmission problems with regular maintenance and care. It's the Best Daily Driver Sports Car on the market even 7 years later. I plan to own this car indefinitely as it will most surely be a sought after Investment Grade Classic Car in 20 years time.  This 1st Gen R8 will be known for putting Audi back into the luxury market of quality built cars.  The versatility of the vehicle on the track as well as touring to the local wineries makes this vehicle a very fun vehicle to own. Not to mention the looks and attention you get when driving it. The car is also easily adoptable to making the V8 into a howling muscle car or with many after market add-ons a show piece worthy of any high end car show. From a practicality view it most definitely blows the doors off any Lambo and is much less common than any Porsche. The corvettes of 2009 don't even compare to the drivability and road hugging capability of this unique car. Anyway you look at it the 1st Gen R8 will take your breath away and if not careful take you up to an easy 90mph before you see the rotating red lights of your local's finest coming up behind you.

The car is so confidence-inspiring that you want to go 10/10th's through every curve and turn. V-10 power might be welcomed but the car is very well- balanced and quick with the V-8. You do need to keep the revs up past 4000 to extract max power & fun. The seats are the best I've felt in an exotic, as comfortable as my A8L. Lots of comfort for two but not much space for things.

I spent a day driving a new A8 loaner with it and didn't like it. The S7 also does not have the Eco engine cutoff feature that the other A7 models have. I find that feature distracting. The S7 is very quick and while not as capable on snow as my old 8 it seems sure footed on wet streets. It did occasionally hydroplane on deeper water because of its wide tires but I changed the tires to a more wet friendly tread and haven't noticed that problem. The 7 has been a great car with only one problem so far. The air suspension was making a noise when the car was cold. But that was last year. We'll see if it picks up again this winter. It's a very impressive, well optioned car at the price point.  I keep trying to justify buying another M or an AMG and I'm always astounded at how much more expensive they are than Audis.

Similar to anyone else looking at this beast of a car, I checked at BMW and MB.

It's not as flashy as either one of its competitors, but that's something I like.  It's understated elegance is perfect for me and anyone else who wants to drive an amazing car that doesn't say ""I'm trying to keep up with the Joneses"".  Car enthusiast know what you're driving but the average person just thinks you got a clean, elegant looking and nice sounding sedan.  Some of my favorite features are the massaging seats (many variations of messaging available), 14 speaker - 630 watt Bose sound system, infotainment system (once you figure it out), options on ambient lighting, Google maps (the best!), Apple Car Play, USB connections (finally), clean exterior lines, gorgeous interior styling, acceleration (off the charts), and finally driving and handling ability!  If I had to give a gripe (and I have a couple), the gas mileage can be really bad if you're not careful and the noise level on highway speeds is higher than I would have liked (It's about the same as the others in it's segment, I'm just used to an SUV and it seemed quite because your higher off the road....I guess).

In comparison no other car felt as athletic, well grounded, and luxurious all in the same package as the S6.  The S6 is awesome, by far the most enjoyable Audi i have ever drove or owned.  I am looking for reasons to take it out (grocery store, pick up fast food, run errands, etc).  The engine gives you massive hp and torque at low rpms, and the exhaust note is intoxicating, but is not overstated.  The S6 has plenty of room for both front and rear passengers, and has lots of tech upgrades such as bose audio system, apple car play, google based navigation, and tons of safety features.  With configurable settings for ride height, transmission, and suspension the car can go from stiff and sporty, to comfort and luxurious for longer drives.  I love this car!",5
442, on 05/04/18 20:34 PM (PDT),Justin T ,2013 Audi S6 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (4.0L 8cyl Turbo 7AM),"Great car, horrendous repairs and maintenance"," I purchased this car with approximately 40,000 miles on it and by 60,000 it needed over $4,000 dollars in repairs. At 50,000 miles the ""check coolant"" message appeared every day until a visit to the dealer revealed that a new water pump was needed at around $2,000 with labor. Not 5,000 miles later the engine developed a high pitch squeal at idle. The remedy for that was a costly repair to the high pressure oil system.  Throughout the ownership of the car a clunking noise could be heard from the passenger footwell over every bump. This was never actually solved but was believed to be the front drive shaft and was replaced. Granted the dealership sympathized with me over the problems I was having and had Audi cover the cost. The adaptive cruise control went out of calibration several times and disabled the cruise until a $400 calibration was completed. Besides from the mechanical issues several interior rattles showed up in quick succession. Maintenance costs were as expected for oil changes but in order to perform the 75,000 mile service the entire front end would have had to be disassembled adding up to a $2,000 plus charge. All that aside the car itself was fantastic. The engine sounded rich and the acceleration was insane. The interior looked premium and the quilted seats were gorgeous. The exterior of the car had just the right blend of sport and luxury. All in all the dealer was exceptional and I would recommend the car if you don't mind the high maintenance and repair costs.",3

The car performs largely as advertised.  Accelleration is steady and very powerful, continues to build way past any speed at which I am comfortable to drive (and way past any highway speed limits). The dual clutch transmission is also smooth and fast, though driving with one takes a little getting used to, particularly when changing from reverse to drive or at low speeds. The sedan is also quite nimble for its size, and with the active suspension it has very little body roll. In particular, it is a pleasure to accelerate through and out of turns, let the torque vector push the car around the bends.  The interior is very quiet and comfortable, and the comfort seat package IMHO is great (I think ventilated seats are a must in a warm climate). My only gripe is that the touchpad system is terrible. Audi uses it for radio presets, and it will often mistake a touch for an attempt at setting a new preset, causing you to have to go back and re-input your intended stations. I just don't use it at all for anything but navigation entry (the handwriting recognition is good). The audio quality is solid (I didn't choose the top-level system, just the upgraded sound).  Fuel economy is about what you'd expect for a car of this type, and I average about 22mpg in mixed driving.

It will keep pace with if not outright decimate most cars out there, and happily put domestic upstarts to shame, while looking so much classier doing so. It handles beautifully, even performs drifts well, especially for a heavy luxury sedan. Every day with this car is a treat, it makes every mile so much more fun than my 08 S4. The onboard tech is very impressive, and for someone with back problems, it's extremely comfortable, even on very long drives (8+hrs).  If you're considering this car and have the desire to spend the money on it that it deserves, just do it. Anyone who says the 3L turbo A6 is comparable is simply wrong. This is an entirely different beast.",5

They are definitely fast but so is a ZR1 corvett or a mustang! Point being, Audi owners have more in mind than pure horsepower. It's the ability to have a car that handles under all conditions and environments, and do it in a way that doesn't say look at me. And seriously, the engine is a thing of beauty! The M5 will take me out until it starts to rain..he'll be in the ditch and I'll be eating dinner! I have seriously considered getting an R8 but can't come to grips with giving up such an all around wonderful car. ",4.875

You can't compare this car to the M5 or the E63, That's what the RS6 is for (We won't get the current 570bhp in the states) For those of us that know about Audis, this car will blow away any E500 or twin Turbo 550i and you will look better doing it.

And while it will no doubt outperform the current V10, it will be a much more generic experience.

I've had a few problems from the suspension airbags to drive seals and electrical bugs. Car is now at 70K. It is a highly engineered car that is also intended as a 'rugged' vehicle.  Maybe too much for the billing. It can be costly to keep but it does run hard, always looks good and is differentiated even from new cars.  It is feature rich and the fit-n-finish quality evident. Depending on driving patterns, off-road etc. the air suspension, brakes and cooling systems can be faulty. You do have the turbo lag and heavy transmission shifting that the manual tiptronic addresses.  The car is a beast in wet or snowy conditions and runs well in cold weather and desert.",4.625

This car is fun to drive and fits a great niche (like a Volvo XC70 or Outback).  Now the bad news.  Reliability.  Or should I say unreliability.  I purchased an allroad certified from the dealer with 30K miles on it.  Since then, the car has had probably 15 trips for repairs, totaling over $20,000.  Everything you can imagine.  The first few years, the dealer covered it.  But I've paid out about $10K personally now.  Audi needs to get its act together.  I hope they do, but this Audi is my last.  ",3.375

The car isn't as reliable as older Audis I've owned, but more reliable than some cars.  Wears tires quickly (a trait of AWD cars) but fat, sticky rubber isn't supposed to last.  It is a car that looks like it belongs in a most affluent customer's driveway.  Positive comments from everyone from airport valet to Samoan tuner/racers to a Porsche racing equipment vendor.

My wife passed away from cancer and it was emotionally difficult for me to drive her car.  I thought the Audi would serve a dual purpose of SUV for camping and nice transportation for travel to my children who live several hours away in snowy regions.  I underestimated the enormous unreliability.

No good explanation from anyone on the cause of the issue other than 'it occasionally happens'. This is my 2nd Audi - first was a 1998 A6 which I purchased. Decided to lease this one.
